A web application designed to track Vocal Function progress, a type of voice therapy. Using a stopwatch and audio feature, the app collects data after a user completes an exercise and sends it to Firebase. The app then organizes a chronological list of completed exercise data and displays it to the user. A user can then delete or export the list in a PDF format. This app was built with the following technologies: HTML, SASS, AngularJS, Javascript, Materialize, and Firebase.
